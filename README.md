</p>

## Overview

Do you have a great idea for a quiz that will entertain and delight Bixby users? Do you want to create a fun quiz to help you learn something new? A quiz to stump your friends? The quiz sample capsule is the perfect place to start building a Bixby quiz capsule!

Both the fundamentals of a Bixby Capsule and some more intermediate/advanced concepts are used. This is a great capsule to learn even more about how to develop for Bixby.

You can easily customize this capsule with your own quiz without any development! Just use the spreadsheet in the `contentUtility` folder and cut and paste from there into the `quizzes.js` file, update the `capsule.id` and `training` as necessary and you have made this capsule your own!

## How to get started

* Download and install the Bixby Studio IDE from the [Bixby Developer Center](http://bixbydevelopers.com)
* Download this capsule (zip is the easiest way) from Github. Unzip in your directory of choice
* Open the Capsule in Bixby Studio
* Open the simulator and give it a try!

## How to try

```

# How to customize
